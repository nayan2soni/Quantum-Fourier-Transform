-> Introduction:
1.1 Motivation:
This initiative is driven by the increasing interest in and promise for quantum computing. A key operation in quantum algorithms is the quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which is particularly important in quantum phase estimation, quantum signal processing, and Shor's integer factorization technique. Our goal in grasping and applying the QFT at the gate level is to enhance our comprehension of quantum circuit design and quantum algorithms. Creating quantum gates by hand is another benefit of this project; this is a necessary skill for creating more complex quantum circuits and algorithms.

This project's main goal is to create the required quantum gates from scratch in order to accomplish the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). The goals are as follows: • Gaining a thorough comprehension of the mathematical ideas underlying the Quantum Fourier Transform. 
• Creating unique quantum gates that are needed for the QFT, such as controlled and single-qubit rotations. 
• Building a quantum circuit that uses a specified input state and the QFT. 
• Confirming via simulation and experimentation that the implemented QFT is accurate. 
• Examining possible improvements and optimizations for the QFT circuit. 
1.3 Problem Statement:
The problem description asks you to use simple quantum gates to design and build a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuit. The project's specific tasks include: • Constructing unique gates for controlled and single-qubit rotations. 
• Putting these gates together to create a circuit that carries out the QFT process. 
• Using testing and simulation to make sure the QFT circuit is built accurately and efficiently. 
• Recording the design procedure, difficulties encountered, and solutions came up with when building gates and implementing circuits. 
1.4 Challenges:
When implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) by creating gates from scratch, there are a number of potential obstacles to overcome, such as: 
• Being aware of the connection between the classical Fourier transform and the mathematical foundations of QFT. 
• Creating accurate and effective quantum gates while taking error correction and gate fidelity into account. 
• Managing intricate quantum operations while taking noise and quantum coherence into account, such as multi-qubit controlled rotations. 
• Taking into account the limits of current quantum devices, confirming the validity of the built QFT circuit by quantum simulation and testing on actual quantum hardware. 
• Optimizing the QFT circuit to maximize efficiency and minimize resource usage without sacrificing accuracy or scalability.
